## Introduction 🚀

The project aims to foster a comprehensive understanding of fundamental C functions, enabling students to write their implementations.

## Objective 🎯

The libft project is an integral part of the 42 school curriculum, serving as the inaugural project. Its primary objective is to create a library encompassing fundamental C functions.

## Usage 🔍

1. In the project's main directory, compile the library using the `make` command.
   `$ make` 

2.  After compilation, include the `libft.a` library in your project.
    `#include "libft.h"`
    
3.  Subsequently, compile your project by including the `libft.a` file and your source file.
    `$ gcc -o my_program my_program.c libft.a`
