## About the Project

The project aims to foster a comprehensive understanding of fundamental C functions, enabling students to write their implementations.

## Usage

1. In the project's main directory, compile the library using the `make` command.
   ` make` 

2.  After compilation, include the `libft.a` library in your project.
    `#include "libft.h"` 
    
3.  Subsequently, compile your project by including the `libft.a` file and your source file.
    `gcc -o my_program my_program.c libft.a` 
    

## Evaluation

Ecole 42 employs Moulinette, an automated assessment tool, to test and evaluate student projects systematically. Moulinette focuses on criteria such as code quality, functionality, error handling, and performance, providing valuable feedback to students.

**Moulinette Evaluation:** To be added... (Include specific details about the evaluation process.)
